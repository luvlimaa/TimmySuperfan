# TimmySuperfan
I designed and created a site through CodeSandbox using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to create a responsive site that included 2 distinct JavaScript features. My site is based on something I am a SuperFan of which is Timothee Chalamet. I have images attached, documenting my process throughout.
